MakeyMakeyMaze
==============

A Game Jam project, developed in a couple of hours, designed to be controlled with a Makey Makey kit.

The game
---------
You control a green sphere on a pitch-dark maze. You can activate a sonar (mouse click) to get a hint about your surroundings and you can move in four directions (arrow keys). You have 120s to find the exit.

The controls
------------
Using a [MakeyMakey Kit](http://www.makeymakey.com/), map the controls to something more interesting. I suggest mapping the mouse click to something that makes a bell-like noise when you tap it (since it works as a sonar), and the arrow keys to something whacky just for the fun of it.
During the [Wooga](http://www.wooga.com) Game Jam, I've mapped the sonar to a metallic bottle and the arrow keys to slices of lemon. We had some good laughs.
